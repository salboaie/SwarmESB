# limiter #

Provides a generic rate limiter for node.js. Useful for API clients, web
crawling, or other tasks that need to be throttled. Two classes are exposed,
RateLimiter and TokenBucket. TokenBucket provides a lower level interface to
rate limiting with a configurable burst rate and drip rate. RateLimiter sits
on top of the token bucket and adds a restriction on the maximum number of
tokens that can be removed each interval to comply with common API
restrictions like "150 requests per hour maximum".

## Fork by @FGRibreau
* Don't wait for available tokens (don't use an internal queue with `setTimeout`)
* Don't use callbacks
* ParentBucket removed

## Installation ##

Use NPM to install:

    npm install limiter

## Usage ##

A simple example allowing 150 requests per hour:

    var RateLimiter = require('limiter').RateLimiter;
    // Allow 150 requests per hour (the Twitter search limit). Also understands
    // 'second', 'minute', 'day', or a number of milliseconds
    var limiter = new RateLimiter(150, 'hour');

    // Throttle requests
    if(limiter.accept(1)){
      callMyRequestSendingFunction(...);
    }

Another example allowing one message to be sent every 250ms:

    var RateLimiter = require('limiter').RateLimiter;
    var limiter = new RateLimiter(1, 250);

    if(limiter.accept(1)){
      callMyMessageSendingFunction(...);
    }

Uses the token bucket directly to throttle at the byte level:

    var BURST_RATE = 1024 * 1024 * 150; // 150KB/sec burst rate
    var FILL_RATE = 1024 * 1024 * 50; // 50KB/sec sustained rate
    var TokenBucket = require('limiter').TokenBucket;
    // We could also pass a parent token bucket in as the last parameter to
    // create a hierarchical token bucket
    var bucket = new TokenBucket(BURST_RATE, FILL_RATE, 'second');

    if(bucket.accept(myData.byteLength)){
      sendMyData(myData);
    });
